## 💻 Project Introduction

### a. Overview

✍️ The To-Do App is a task management tool that helps users organize, schedule, and track their daily tasks. It supports task creation, editing, completion tracking, progress monitoring, and provides feedback with analytics and calendar views.

### b. Key Features & Function Manual

✍️ Add Tasks: Create tasks with title, description, start/due dates, and daily target minutes.
✍️ Edit Tasks: Update task details anytime.
✍️ Delete Tasks: Remove tasks you no longer need.
✍️ Mark as Done: Mark tasks as completed manually or automatically after reaching daily goals.
✍️ Start/Pause Timer: Track real working time for each task.
✍️ Subtasks/Checklist: Break tasks into smaller steps.
✍️ Calendar View: See tasks on weekly/monthly calendars.
✍️ Analytics Dashboard: View completion percentage, streaks, deficits, and deadline pressure.
✍️ Notifications: Toast + sound alerts for completed tasks, overdue tasks, or missed quotas.

### c. Unique Features (What’s special about this app?) 

✍️ Audio + Visual Feedback: Theme colors change and sounds play depending on task outcomes (success, warning, missed).
✍️ Quota Alerts: If the daily goal is reached but the timer is still running, the app keeps warning until the user clicks Done.
✍️ Hit Calendar: Days that reach 100% completion are highlighted with a ⭐ in the calendar.
✍️ Deadline Pressure Metric: Shows how close you are to deadlines, helping to prioritize tasks better.

### d. Technology Stack and Implementation Methods

✍️ Frontend: React + TypeScript
✍️ State Management: Zustand (with persist in localStorage)
✍️ Routing: React Router v6
✍️ Styling: TailwindCSS + custom components
✍️ Date Handling: date-fns
✍️ Persistence: LocalStorage via Zustand persist
✍️ Notifications: HTML5 Audio API for sound, CSS theme switching for UI feedback

### e. Service Architecture & Database structure (when used)

✍️ Architecture: Pure frontend single-page application (SPA). Using IndexedDB through localforage  
✍️ Task Schema (simplified):
'''
type Task = {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description?: string;
  category: string;
  status: "todo" | "in_progress" | "done";
  dailyMinutes: number;
  startDate: string;
  dueDate: string;
  progress: Record<string, number>; // per day progress
  runningFrom?: string;
  completedAt?: string;
  checklist?: { id: string; text: string; done: boolean }[];
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
};
'''

## 🧠 Reflection

### a. If you had more time, what would you expand?

✍️ Add backend & database to sync tasks across devices.
✍️ Support team collaboration (assign tasks, track progress in groups).
✍️ Implement push/email reminders.
✍️ Add dark mode and customizable themes.


### b. If you integrate AI APIs more for your app, what would you do?

✍️ Use AI to suggest optimal daily schedules based on deadlines and user productivity history.
✍️ AI-powered task prioritization.
✍️ Natural language task creation (e.g., “Study math 2 hours every day until Friday”).
✍️ AI productivity coach that gives personalized advice and reminders.
